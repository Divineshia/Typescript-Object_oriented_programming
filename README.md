# Typescript-Object_oriented_programming
TypeScript boasts features that go beyond (and sometimes challenge) JavaScript approaches. 
But this superset of JavaScript really shines in the area of object-oriented programming (OOP). 
If you're familiar with JavaScript and want to incorporate OOP principles into your workflow using TypeScript, then this course is for you.
These excercises practiced on why TypeScript uses object-oriented programming models and covers a range of topics, including inheritance, polymorphism, generics, and encapsulation. 
Along the way, working challenges that allow to put understanding of these new concepts to the test.
